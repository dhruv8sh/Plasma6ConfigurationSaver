Plasma Configuration Saver
===========
An applet to save your plasma configurations and change them on the fly.

## Warning:
- This is currently experimental, save your work before using.
- Your configurations will be safe, but you might experience crashes.
- Run `systemctl --user restart plasma-plasmashell` if the panels or the wallpaper stop showing. And they should be back.

## Install
To install run `plasmapkg2 -i .` in the directory of the project.

## Current Status
- Runs **almost** perfectly in plasmoidviewer.
- Crashes when applying theme after applet installed.
- Need to logout and login to see the changes in Color Scheme and such.
